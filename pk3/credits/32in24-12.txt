Description             : "In 1974 a crack commando unit was sent to
                          prison again for another crime that they
                          seriously didn't commit only this time they
                          were sent to Japan to participate in a
                          terrible cooking themed mapping game show for
                          the ultimate prize: burgers designed to have
                          the hell eaten out of them.
                          
                          Surviving purely on rations of Lunchables and
                          Arizona Watermelon Punch the YEDS team has
                          pooled together its resources to take Japan
                          by storm with the craziest CTF maps known to
                          man.

(Of course, CDROM.COM doesn't exist anymore, so replace everything before
"gothic*.zip" with
"ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pc/games/idgames/levels/doom2/deathmatch/megawads/".
We'd edit the disclaimer above, but the Gothic Crew insists we include it in
its entirety and they didn't consider the possibility of CDROM.COM no longer
existing.  Blame them, not us!)
