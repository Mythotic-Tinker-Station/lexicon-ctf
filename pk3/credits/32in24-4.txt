Description             : More 32in24, MAN WE JUST CAN'T STOP SHITTING OUT
			  LEVELS FROM our assholes! In this installment we
			  take on the unbreakable pillars of zdctfmp and
			  zdctfmp2 and produce a mapset that is clearly
			  superior than zdctfmp3 and done in less time to
			  boot! Not only that, but you can play them in
			  Odamex, ZDaemon and Skulltag! So what's on the 
			  menu today?

Additional Credits To	: The following people who wasted Essel's and
			  my time fixing their retarded errors

			  Nautilus, Tango, Kassman, GhoulSlayeR and
			  Revenant for not reading the rules stating that
			  you had to put in a player 1 start and a
			  deathmatch start! I don't think I need to point
			  out how stupid that was.

			  MethoD, Lazureus, essel, Revenant, Icarus,
			  Kassman, Bucket and Tango for all placing 3D mode
			  starts in their maps! Great job in testing your
			  map in all compatible ports.

			  Bucket and Tuomio for setting every goddamn item
			  to multiplayer only! THIS SHITS ME A LOT SO STOP
			  DOING IT FOR FUCKS SAKE

			  Nautilus and ClonedPickle for fucking up the
			  team starts by putting them in the wrong place!
			  You guys deserve a special medal!

			  Esselfortium for compiling the textures he stole
                          from Toke, NiGHTMARE, SargeBaldy, and anyone else
                          I forgot. Also thanks Essel for modifying GRAY*,
                          STARTAN*, BROWNGRN, PANEL*, METAL1/FLOOR4_8, and
                          BIGBRIK specifically for 32in24 because he is so
                          dedicated and talented! Also he made the awesome
                          titlepic!

			  Lazureus for having a massive breakdown and PMS
			  session!
